=======================================================
STEP 1: LOAD DATA

We load the raw CSV file and check its size.
  Rows    : 255,347  (each row = one loan)
  Columns : 18   (each column = one piece of information)
=======================================================
STEP 2: BASIC CHECKS

Checking for missing values, duplicate rows, and duplicate IDs.
These are the three most common problems in real datasets.

  Missing values  : 0  ✓ No action needed
  Duplicate rows  : 0   ✓ No action needed
  Duplicate IDs   : 0   ✓ No action needed
=======================================================
STEP 3: VALIDITY CHECKS

Checking that all numbers are within realistic ranges.
Example: age must be 18+, credit score must be 300-850 (300–850 is the official FICO credit score range created in 1989.).

  Age < 18 (below legal borrowing age)       → ✓ OK
  Age > 100 (unrealistic age)                → ✓ OK
  CreditScore < 300 (below minimum)          → ✓ OK
  CreditScore > 850 (above maximum)          → ✓ OK
  Income < 0 (impossible)                    → ✓ OK
  LoanAmount < 0 (impossible)                → ✓ OK
  DTIRatio < 0 (impossible)                  → ✓ OK
  DTIRatio > 1 (above 100% of income)        → ✓ OK
  InterestRate < 0 (impossible)              → ✓ OK
  InterestRate > 100 (unrealistic)           → ✓ OK
  MonthsEmployed < 0 (impossible)            → ✓ OK

=======================================================
STEP 4: INCONSISTENCY CHECK

Checking for values that conflict with each other.
Example: a borrower listed as Unemployed but has months employed > 0.

  Unemployed borrowers with MonthsEmployed > 0 : 63,292

  Decision: KEEP these rows.
  Reason  : MonthsEmployed likely represents total past work history,
            not current job duration. An unemployed person can still
            have 5 years of past employment experience.
=======================================================
STEP 5: CLASS BALANCE CHECK

Checking how many loans defaulted vs did not default.
  No Default (0) : 225,694  (88.4%)
  Defaulted  (1) : 29,653  (11.6%)

  Note: Dataset is imbalanced (88% vs 12%).
  For dashboard → no problem, charts work fine.
  For ML model  → handle with oversampling or class weights.
=======================================================
STEP 6: FEATURE ENGINEERING

Creating 2 new columns that give more insight than raw numbers.

  NEW COLUMN 1: LTIRatio
  Formula : LoanAmount ÷ Income
  
  Min  → the single smallest  value in the entire dataset
Max  → the single largest  value in the entire dataset
Mean → the average of all 255,347 LTI values added together

  Meaning : How many times their yearly salary did they borrow?
  Min     : 0.03  (borrowed almost nothing vs income)
  Max     : 16.53  (borrowed 16x their annual salary)
  Mean    : 2.18  (average borrower borrowed 2x salary)
  Safe    : Below 4.0  |  Dangerous: Above 4.0

  NEW COLUMN 2: RiskTier
  Formula : Score from DTI + CreditScore + Employment + LTI + CoSigner
  Meaning : Overall risk level of each loan in one simple label
  Low     : 90,520 loans  (35.4%)  — safe borrowers
  Medium  : 119,680 loans  (46.9%)  — watch closely
  High    : 45,147 loans  (17.7%)  — danger zone

=======================================================
STEP 7: SAVE CLEAN FILE

Saving the processed dataset as a new file.
The original Loan_default.csv is kept untouched.

  Saved   → Loan_default_clean.csv
  Rows    : 255,347
  Columns : 20  (original 18 + LTIRatio + RiskTier)
